# Single Thread Efficiency vs. Thread Pool Efficiency

An experiment conducted to analyze the efficiency differences between using a set number $n$ of individual threads, all performing the same task (in this case, counting prime numbers from 1 to 10,000,000), and employing a thread pool consisting of $k$ threads to which $n$ tasks are assigned for execution.
